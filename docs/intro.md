# Overview

Let's discover the basics of the system.

## Main features of the system

These are the main features of the system:

- Select and move hundreds of units around a map
- Units avoid each other and the environment
- Different types of units with separate logic
- Create formations (e.g. grid or circle)
- Units have a task queue (e.g. “Move to location” and then “Gather resource”)

## Working with the system

The Pioneer Mass Movement System is mainly a C++ project utilizing the mass framework. C++ knowledge and a basic understanding of the mass framework is required to use the system in your own project.

Without C++ knowledge, you are only able to add and change the assets. For example, you can add your own units, buildings or resources. However adding custom logic via bleuprints is tricky because the system uses the mass framework and the majority of the logic there is written in C++.
